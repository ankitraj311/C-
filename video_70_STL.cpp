#include<iostream>



/*
 * STL
 * 1. Container : object which store data
 * 2. Alog	: Procedure to process data.
 * 3. Iterator	: object which point to an element of a container
 *
 * Container are of three type :
 * 1. Sequence Container : Store Data in Linear fashion, example Vector, List, Dqueue
 * 2. Associative Container : Direct access, like set, Multiset, Map, MultiMap, Dicitonary, Store data in tree
 * 3. Derived Containers : Best use for Real world Modelling,like Stack, queue, priority queue
 *
 *
 * When to use which ?
 *
 * Sequence Container : Random Access is fast, Insertion & Deletion is relativly SLow, Insertion and Deletion at the end is Fast.
 * 
 * List Container : Random acces in List is Slow, beacuse we goes with address in the element like in linked-List
 *
 * Insertion in the Middle is Fast like in Linked List, No shifting of Element is required in it.
 * Insertion at the END is Fast.
 *
 *
 * Associative Container : All operation is fast execpt Random Access
 *
 *
 * Derived Container : Depends on the real world scenario
